# QuickDefine
Browser extension for Firefox that pops up a definition of a word when double-clicked while Ctrl is pressed.

When the user holds down Ctrl on their keyboard and double-clicks a word, an API pull request is sent to *dictionaryapi.dev*, the result is then displayed in a popup.
The popup will close automatically after 3 seconds, which will be paused if the cursor is hovering over it, and can be closed early by clicking the close button.
